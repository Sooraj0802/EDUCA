        <p>About CSS
            Cascading Style Sheet is a style language used to add visual design to web pages.
            CSS selectors are used for targeting HTML elements and applying specific styles.
            We can define how HTML elements (text, background, image, etc.) appear on a webpage using CSS properties.
            CSS allows responsive design; web pages can adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
            We can control the layout of multiple web pages at once using CSS.
            Why Learn CSS?
            CSS makes a website visually appealing. You can add CSS style to your HTML pages to create professional websites with refined and elegant aesthetics.
            You can make your website responsive with CSS, which enhances user experience by allowing them to view your website on any device without any problem.
            CSS makes our website more accessible. CSS allows people with visual impairments to use the website as you can change fonts and font size; color combinations and contrasts; and much more.
            CSS is an easy language to learn. You can start styling your document after learning some very basic CSS.
            We can add animations and transitions to a webpage, making it more engaging and interactive without the use of JavaScript.
